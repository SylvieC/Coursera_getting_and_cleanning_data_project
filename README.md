This repository is a project in the Getting and Cleaning Data Coursera Class

We were given a directory with files containing data https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip

From the data given, we were to create one R script called run_analysis.R that does the following. 
* Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
* Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
* Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
* Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
* From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.


Assuming the folder is in the working directory, you can run the script run_analysis.R  in your R console with:
* source("run_analysis.R")
